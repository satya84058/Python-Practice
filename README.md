# 🧮 Python Logical Comparison Program

This project is a simple yet structured Python program demonstrating **loops, conditional statements, arithmetic operations, and function usage**.  
It performs a series of mathematical computations and comparisons between variables `a` and `e` — finally ensuring that both become equal using a custom function.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Uses **loops** (`for` loop) to perform iterative calculations.  
- Demonstrates **conditional logic** (`if`, `else`, `!=`, `==`).  
- Implements **functions** for modular, clean code:
  - `calculate_values(a, b)` → performs math calculations each iteration.  
  - `adjust_values(a, e)` → adjusts variables to make `a` equal to `e`.  
- Ensures the **final output is always “Yes”** (when `e == a`).  
- Fully commented and beginner-friendly.

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Variables and Arithmetic Operators  
- For Loops  
- Conditional Statements  
- Functions and Return Values  
- Dynamic Variable Updates

## 💡 Program Flow

1. Initialize variables `a` and `b`.  
2. Run a loop 8 times to calculate:
   - `c = a + b`
   - `d = 2 * c`
   - `e = d - b`
   - Update `a` and `b` dynamically.  
3. Perform multiple logical checks after the loop.  
4. If `a` and `e` are not equal, use the function `adjust_values(a, e)` to make them equal.  
5. Print `"✅ Final Output: Yes"` when equality is achieved.

## 🧩 Example Output

```

----- Starting the Loop -----
Iteration 1: e = 25.00, a = 1.67, b = 31.67
Iteration 2: e = 61.67, a = 1.77, b = 124.43
...
----- After Loop Ends -----
No (e != a after loop)
x = -60.00
Updated a = 1.67
No (after a = x + e)
y = 1541.67

Adjusting values to make e == a...

✅ Final Output: Yes (e and a are now equal!)

## 🧾 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-logical-comparison.git
````

2. Navigate to the folder:

   ```bash
   cd python-logical-comparison
   ```
3. Run the program:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 🏁 Output Goal

The final output will always print:

```
✅ Final Output: Yes (e and a are now equal!)
```
